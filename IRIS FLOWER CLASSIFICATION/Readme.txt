Here, I download given dataset from kaggle which is related to our task. I analysis IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION using python.


Data Loading and Exploration: Loads the Iris dataset and provides descriptive statistics.
Visualization: Employs various plots (pie charts, box plots, histograms, density plots, pair plots, violin plots, and scatter plots) to visualize data distributions and relationships.
Correlation Analysis: Calculates and presents the correlation matrix for numerical features.
Machine Learning Models: Experiments with four classification models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes) to predict Iris species.
Model Evaluation: Calculates accuracy scores for each model and summarizes the results in a table.
